|     You have a (more or less) 'large supercell' and for larger cells it     |
|     might be more efficient to use real-space projection operators.         |
|     Therefore, try LREAL= Auto in the INCAR file.                           |
|     Mind: For very accurate calculation, you might also keep the            |
|     reciprocal projection scheme (i.e. LREAL=.FALSE.).                      |

|     The number of bands has been changed from the values supplied in        |
|     the INCAR file. This is a result of running the parallel version.       |
|     The orbitals not found in the WAVECAR file will be initialized with     |
|     random numbers, which is usually adequate. For correlated               |
|     calculations, however, you should redo the groundstate calculation.     |
|     I found NBANDS = 1072. Now, NBANDS = 1092.                              |
|                                                                             |
