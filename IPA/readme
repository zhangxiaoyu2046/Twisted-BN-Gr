For large supercells, the electronic minimization algorithm is chosen to be blocked Davidson iteration scheme (ALGO = Normal).
This parameter has been tested against ALGO = Exact, and their IPA spectra are the same at 0Â°. We thus think this parameter produces reliable results, while saving lots of computational resources.
